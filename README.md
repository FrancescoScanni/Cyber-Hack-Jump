# Cyber Hack Jump - Desktop game

Cyber Hack Jump is a simple cyberpunk-inspired, neon-styled 2D desktop game built with JavaScript, Kaboom.js, and Tailwind CSS.
You control a cyberpunk hacker avatar who must jump across floating platforms, collect glowing data coins, and avoid deadly block collisions (there are also special gears!!!).
The game features smooth physics, pixel art sprites, and a vibrant cyber aesthetic; all playable directly in the browser with no installs required. Hope you all enjoy ;)
